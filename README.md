Salt's server

### Setup

Add the URL of the mongodb database as well as a private key to config.json.

Install the required dependencies using npm, then launch the server using npm.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Note: Salt Server requires an instance of mongodb to be running in the background to function.
